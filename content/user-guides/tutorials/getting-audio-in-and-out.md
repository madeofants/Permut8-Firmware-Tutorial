- The audio sounds identical to the original (no changes)
- You understand the basic structure every plugin needs
- You're ready to start modifying and creating effects

---

## Step 2: Create Your First Plugin

### 2.1 The Absolute Minimum Code
Create a new text file called `audio_passthrough.impala`:

```impala
// My First Plugin - Audio Passthrough
const int PRAWN_FIRMWARE_PATCH_FORMAT = 2

// Required parameter constants
const int OPERAND_1_HIGH_PARAM_INDEX
const int OPERAND_1_LOW_PARAM_INDEX
const int OPERAND_2_HIGH_PARAM_INDEX
const int OPERAND_2_LOW_PARAM_INDEX
const int OPERATOR_1_PARAM_INDEX
const int OPERATOR_2_PARAM_INDEX
const int SWITCHES_PARAM_INDEX
const int CLOCK_FREQ_PARAM_INDEX
const int PARAM_COUNT

global array signal[2]
global array params[PARAM_COUNT]
global array displayLEDs[4]

function process()
locals int inputL, int inputR
{
    loop {
        // Audio automatically passes through - we don't need to do anything!
        yield()
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Understanding Each Line

**Line 1: Comment**
```impala
// My First Plugin - Audio Passthrough
```
- Comments start with `//` and help you remember what your code does
- Always document your plugins for future reference

**Line 2: Format Declaration**
```impala
const int PRAWN_FIRMWARE_PATCH_FORMAT = 2
```
- **REQUIRED** - tells Permut8 this is a valid plugin
- Must be exactly this line in every plugin you create
- Version 2 is for Permut8 v1.1 and later

**Lines 4-6: Global Variables**
```impala
global array signal[2]      // Audio input and output
global array params[PARAM_COUNT]      // Knob values from hardware
global array displayLEDs[4] // LED display control
```
- **REQUIRED** - these connect your plugin to Permut8 hardware
- `signal[2]` = left and right audio channels
- `params[PARAM_COUNT]` = values from 8 knobs (we'll use these later)
- `displayLEDs[4]` = control for LED displays (we'll use these later)

**Lines 8-14: Main Processing Function**
```impala
function process()
{
    loop {
        // Audio automatically passes through
        yield()
    }
}
```
- **REQUIRED** - this function runs continuously while your plugin is active
- `loop { }` = infinite loop that processes audio forever
- `yield()` = **CRITICAL** - gives control back to Permut8 after each audio sample
- Audio passes through automatically - you don't need to copy it manually

---

## Step 3: Compile and Test

### 3.1 Compile Your Plugin
1. Open command prompt in your Permut8 Firmware Code directory
2. Type: `PikaCmd.exe -compile audio_passthrough.impala`
3. **Expected result**: You should see `audio_passthrough.gazl` created
4. **If compilation fails**: Check that you typed the code exactly as shown

### 3.2 Load Into Permut8
1. Open your DAW with Permut8 loaded
2. Click the **console button** (bottom-right of Permut8 interface)
3. In the console, type: `patch audio_passthrough.gazl`
4. Press Enter

### 3.3 Test Audio Passthrough
1. **Play audio** through Permut8 (any audio source will work)
2. **Expected result**: You should hear the audio exactly as it was before
3. **Success indicator**: Audio plays normally with no changes
4. **If no audio**: Check your DAW routing and Permut8 input/output settings

**ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!** You just created and loaded your first custom Permut8 plugin!

## Step 4: Understanding What Just Happened

### 4.1 The Audio Flow
```
Audio Input â†’ Your Plugin â†’ Audio Output
```

**Behind the scenes:**
1. Permut8 receives audio from your DAW
2. Permut8 puts audio samples into `signal[0]` (left) and `signal[1]` (right)
3. Your `process()` function runs once per audio sample
4. Since you didn't change `signal[0]` or `signal[1]`, audio passes through unchanged
5. Permut8 sends the audio back to your DAW

### 4.2 The Real-Time Loop
```impala
loop {
    // This runs 44,100 times per second (at 44.1kHz sample rate)
    // Each time, it processes one audio sample
    yield()  // Give control back so next sample can be processed
}
```

**Key concept:** Your plugin processes one tiny audio sample at a time, 44,100 times per second. The `yield()` is essential - without it, your plugin would hang and no audio would play.

### 4.3 Why This Matters
**This simple structure is the foundation for EVERY plugin:**
- Want to make a volume control? Modify `signal[0]` and `signal[1]` before `yield()`
- Want to add delay? Store samples in a buffer before outputting them
- Want to add distortion? Apply math to the signal values
- Want LED feedback? Set values in `displayLEDs[]`

---

## Step 5: Make a Simple Modification

### 5.1 Add a Volume Control
Let's prove you can modify audio. Replace your `process()` function:

```impala
function process()
locals int inputL, int inputR
{
    loop {
        // Reduce volume to half (simple volume control)
        signal[0] = signal[0] / 2  // Left channel half volume
        signal[1] = signal[1] / 2  // Right channel half volume
        
        yield()
    }
}
```

### 5.2 Test the Volume Control
1. **Compile**: `PikaCmd.exe -compile audio_passthrough.impala`
2. **Load**: `patch audio_passthrough.gazl`
3. **Expected result**: Audio should now be quieter (half volume)
4. **Success indicator**: Clear volume reduction while maintaining audio quality

### 5.3 Understanding the Change
```impala
signal[0] = signal[0] / 2  // Take left audio, divide by 2, put it back
signal[1] = signal[1] / 2  // Take right audio, divide by 2, put it back
```

**What this does:**
- Reads the current audio sample from `signal[0]` (left channel)
- Divides it by 2 (making it half as loud)
- Puts the modified sample back into `signal[0]`
- Does the same for the right channel
- Audio flows out to your DAW with reduced volume

---

## Step 6: Add LED Feedback

### 6.1 Visual Confirmation Your Plugin Is Running
Add this line before `yield()`:

```impala
function process()
locals int inputL, int inputR
{
    loop {
        signal[0] = signal[0] / 2
        signal[1] = signal[1] / 2
        
        // Light up first LED to show plugin is active
        displayLEDs[0] = 0xFF  // 0xFF = all LEDs on in first display
        
        yield()
    }
}
```

### 6.2 Test LED Feedback
1. **Compile and load** as before
2. **Expected result**: First LED display should light up fully
3. **Success indicator**: Visual confirmation your plugin is running

### 6.3 Understanding LED Control
```impala
displayLEDs[0] = 0xFF  // First LED display, all 8 LEDs on
```

**LED values:**
- `0x00` = all LEDs off
- `0x01` = only first LED on
- `0xFF` = all 8 LEDs on
- `0x0F` = first 4 LEDs on
- You have 4 LED displays: `displayLEDs[0]` through `displayLEDs[3]`

## Step 7: Complete Working Plugin

### 7.1 Final Version with Comments
Here's your complete first plugin with full documentation:

```impala
// Audio Passthrough with Volume Control - My First Plugin

const int OPERAND_2_LOW_PARAM_INDEX
const int OPERATOR_1_PARAM_INDEX
const int OPERATOR_2_PARAM_INDEX
const int SWITCHES_PARAM_INDEX
const int CLOCK_FREQ_PARAM_INDEX
const int PARAM_COUNT

// Required global variables that connect to Permut8 hardware
global array signal[2]      // Audio I/O: signal[0] = left, signal[1] = right
global array params[PARAM_COUNT]      // Knob values: params[0] through params[7] (0-255 each)
global array displayLEDs[4] // LED displays: displayLEDs[0] through displayLEDs[3]

// Main processing function - runs continuously while plugin is active
function process()
locals int inputL, int inputR
{
    loop {
        // Process audio: reduce volume to half
        signal[0] = signal[0] / 2  // Left channel volume control
        signal[1] = signal[1] / 2  // Right channel volume control
        
        // Visual feedback: light up LED to show plugin is running
        displayLEDs[0] = 0xFF      // All LEDs on in first display
        
        // CRITICAL: Return control to Permut8 for next audio sample
        yield()
    }
}
```

### 8.3 Experiment Ideas
**Try these modifications:**
```impala
// Different volume levels
signal[0] = signal[0] * 2    // Double volume (be careful - can be loud!)
signal[0] = signal[0] / 4    // Quarter volume

// Mute one channel
signal[0] = 0               // Mute left channel
signal[1] = signal[1]       // Keep right channel

// Swap left and right
int temp = signal[0]
signal[0] = signal[1]       // Left gets right audio
signal[1] = temp            // Right gets left audio

// Different LED patterns
displayLEDs[0] = 0x01       // Only first LED
displayLEDs[0] = 0xAA       // Alternating LEDs (10101010)
displayLEDs[0] = 0x0F       // First 4 LEDs
```

**ðŸŽ‰ You're now ready to start creating real audio effects!** Every complex plugin starts with these same basic concepts - you've mastered the foundation.
