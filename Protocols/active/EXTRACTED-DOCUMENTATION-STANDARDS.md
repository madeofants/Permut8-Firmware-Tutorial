## üî§ TERMINOLOGY AND CONSISTENCY

### **Technical Term Management**
```markdown
# Terminology Standards

## Core Language Terms (Use Consistently)
- **yield()** - Always use parentheses, explain cooperative multitasking
- **signal[]** - Always use array notation, specify [0] for left, [1] for right
- **params[]** - Always use array notation, specify index for specific parameter
- **real-time** - Use hyphenated form when adjective, "real time" when noun
- **DSP** - Always capitalize, spell out on first use in section
- **firmware** - Lowercase unless part of proper name

## Hardware-Specific Terms
- **Permut8** - Always capitalize, trademark
- **GAZL** - Always uppercase, explain as compiled assembly format
- **12-bit audio** - Specify bit depth, range -2047 to 2047
- **console** - Lowercase, refers to plugin's debug interface

## Avoid These Patterns
- ‚ùå "code" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "firmware" or "implementation"
- ‚ùå "function" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "native function" or specific type
- ‚ùå "the user" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "you" (direct address)
- ‚ùå "one can" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "you can" (conversational tone)
```

### **Voice and Tone Guidelines**
```markdown
# Writing Voice Standards

## Tone Characteristics
- **Encouraging**: "You'll create..." rather than "This tutorial covers..."
- **Direct**: "Click the button" rather than "The button should be clicked"
- **Confident**: "This will work" rather than "This should work"
- **Practical**: Focus on immediate application over theoretical discussion

## Voice Consistency
- **Use active voice**: "Create the function" not "The function is created"
- **Address reader directly**: "You" not "the developer" or "one"
- **Present tense for instructions**: "Add the code" not "You will add"
- **Specific over general**: "8 parameters" not "several parameters"

## Professional Standards
- **No contractions in headings**: "Do not" not "Don't" in titles
- **Contractions OK in body**: Natural, conversational flow
- **Technical precision**: Exact parameter names, values, ranges
- **Inclusive language**: Avoid assumptions about reader background
```

## üìä FORMATTING AND STRUCTURE

### **Markdown Standards**
```markdown
# Formatting Consistency Rules

## Header Hierarchy
# Document Title (H1 - only one per document)
## Major Section (H2)
### Subsection (H3)
#### Detail Level (H4 - sparingly)

## Code Block Standards
```language
// Always specify language for syntax highlighting
// Include explanatory comments
// Use real, working examples
```

## List Formatting
- **Unordered lists**: Use `-` consistently
- **Ordered lists**: Use numbers for sequential steps
- **Definition lists**: **Term**: Definition format
- **Checkboxes**: - [ ] for task lists

## Emphasis Patterns
- **Bold**: For UI elements, important terms, strong emphasis
- *Italic*: For variables, file names, first introduction of terms
- `Code`: For inline code, function names, parameters
- > Blockquotes: For important notes, warnings, or citations

## Link Standards
- [Descriptive text](url) - Always use descriptive link text
- Internal links: [Section Name](#section-name)
- Reference links: [Text][1] at bottom for long URLs
```

### **Code Example Standards**
```markdown
# Code Quality Requirements

## Complete Examples Only
‚úÖ Good: Full working function with all necessary components
‚ùå Bad: Code fragments that won't compile

## Comment Standards
```impala
// Explain WHY, not WHAT
function process() {
    // Process each audio sample in real-time
    loop {
        signal[0] = applyGain(signal[0], volume);  // Left channel
        signal[1] = applyGain(signal[1], volume);  // Right channel
        yield();  // REQUIRED: Return control to audio engine
    }
}
```

## Error Prevention
- Always include necessary headers/declarations
- Use correct syntax for target language
- Provide realistic parameter values
- Include boundary checking where needed
```
