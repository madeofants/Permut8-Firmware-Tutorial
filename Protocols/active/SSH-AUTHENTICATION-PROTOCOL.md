# SSH Authentication Protocol

**Purpose**: Secure reference for GitHub repository authentication using SSH deploy keys  
**Security Level**: Local development environment only  
**Last Updated**: June 16, 2025  

## üîê Authentication Overview

This repository uses SSH deploy keys for secure GitHub authentication. The SSH key configuration follows standard GitHub SSH authentication patterns.

## üìã Authentication Steps

### **Locate SSH Configuration**
SSH keys are typically stored in the user's standard SSH directory:
```bash
# Standard SSH directory location
~/.ssh/

# Common key file names
id_rsa (private key)
id_rsa.pub (public key)
```

### **For Repository Push Operations**

1. **Verify SSH Agent Status**
   ```bash
   # Check if SSH agent is running
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

2. **Add SSH Key to Agent**
   ```bash
   # Add private key to SSH agent
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

3. **Test GitHub Connection**
   ```bash
   # Verify SSH authentication with GitHub
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

4. **Execute Push**
   ```bash
   # Push commits to remote repository
   git push origin main
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### **Key Management**
- SSH keys should never be committed to repository
- Private keys remain on local development machine only
- Public keys are configured in GitHub repository deploy key settings

### **Authentication Flow**
- SSH keys provide secure, password-free authentication
- Deploy keys grant repository-specific access permissions
- No credentials stored in repository or commit history

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
1. **"Permission denied (publickey)"**
   - SSH key not added to SSH agent
   - Public key not configured in GitHub repository settings
   - Wrong private key file path

2. **"Could not read from remote repository"**
   - Repository access permissions not configured
   - Deploy key not activated in GitHub settings

### **Resolution Steps**
1. Verify SSH key exists in standard location
2. Add key to SSH agent using `ssh-add`
3. Test connection with `ssh -T git@github.com`
4. Confirm deploy key is active in GitHub repository settings

## üìÅ Standard SSH Directory Structure

```
~/.ssh/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ id_rsa                    # Private key (never share)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ id_rsa.pub                # Public key (added to GitHub)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ known_hosts               # Verified host fingerprints
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config                    # SSH client configuration
```

## ‚úÖ Authentication Protocol

**Step 1**: Verify SSH key exists  
**Step 2**: Add key to SSH agent  
**Step 3**: Test GitHub connection  
**Step 4**: Execute git operations  

This protocol ensures secure, authenticated access to the GitHub repository while maintaining proper security practices for SSH key management.
