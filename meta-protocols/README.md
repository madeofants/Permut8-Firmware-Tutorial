1. **Copy the project ingestion template**:
   ```bash
   cp meta-protocols/PROJECT-INGESTION-TEMPLATE.md [PROJECT-NAME]-INGESTION.md
   ```

2. **Customize the template** by replacing all `[PLACEHOLDER]` sections with project-specific information

3. **Select relevant protocols** from the other files based on your project needs

4. **Adapt protocols** for your specific tech stack and requirements

### **For Existing Projects**
1. **Review session management protocols** to improve continuity
2. **Implement quality frameworks** for systematic assessment
3. **Add build workflows** for automation needs
4. **Apply file safety protocols** for better protection

## üîß ADAPTATION GUIDELINES

### **Universal Principles (Apply to All Projects)**
- **Session Recovery Commands**: Always implement for project continuity
- **Todo Management**: Use TodoWrite extensively for task tracking
- **File Safety**: Work on copies, backup before changes
- **Quality Gates**: Define clear success criteria for each phase

### **Tech Stack Adaptations**
- **Python Projects**: Emphasize virtual environments, testing frameworks
- **JavaScript/Node Projects**: Focus on package management, build tools
- **Compiled Languages**: Add compilation validation, performance monitoring
- **Scripting Projects**: Emphasize automation, batch processing

### **Team Size Adaptations**
- **Solo Developer**: Simplified protocols, focus on continuity and quality
- **Small Team**: Add collaboration protocols, shared standards
- **Large Team**: Comprehensive documentation, formal approval processes
