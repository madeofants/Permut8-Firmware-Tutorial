# SESSION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

**Purpose**: Reusable framework for managing complex documentation projects across multiple sessions  
**Extracted From**: Session-start.md, session-continuity-protocol.md, and SESSION-RECOVERY-GUIDE.md  
**Application**: Any multi-session documentation or development project requiring continuity

---

## ðŸ”„ CORE SESSION MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES

### **1. PREVENTION-FIRST APPROACH**
- **Never delete without explicit permission** - Distinguish between content vs infrastructure
- **Always ask before major edits** - Present detailed plans and wait for approval
- **Historical records are sacred** - Session logs and protocol documents preserve project knowledge
- **Major changes require approval protocol** - Bulk changes, structural reorganization, file deletion

### **2. AUTO-SAVE REQUIREMENTS**
Update tracking systems after every major task completion:

#### **Immediate Task Completion Actions**
```markdown
// After completing any significant work unit:
1. TodoWrite - Mark task as "completed"
2. TodoWrite - Update next task to "in_progress" if continuing
3. Document progress in current session log
4. Add critical findings or patterns discovered
```

#### **Session Log Requirements**
- **File naming**: `session-[DATE]-[brief-description].md`
- **Required information**: Tasks completed, current status, critical findings, files modified, handoff instructions
- **Update frequency**: After every major task, brief notes after minor tasks

### **3. SESSION RECOVERY PROTOCOL**

#### **Universal Session Ingestion Command**
```
read session docs to recover progress: TodoRead + Read [PROJECT_STATUS_TRACKER] + Read [SESSION_START_GUIDE] + Read [LATEST_SESSION_LOG] + Task "find most recent session log"
```

#### **Mandatory Startup Checklist**
1. âœ… Read session-start guide completely
2. âœ… Read project meta-analysis for full strategy  
3. âœ… Use TodoRead to check current task status
4. âœ… Find and read most recent session log
5. âœ… Verify current working directory location
6. âœ… Understand what work was completed in previous sessions
7. âœ… Identify the specific next action to take
8. âœ… Never delete files without explicit user permission

### **4. CRASH RECOVERY TEMPLATE**
```markdown
## Session Recovery Check - [Date]

### Context Verification
- [ ] Read session-start rules
- [ ] Read project strategy document
- [ ] Checked TodoRead for current status
- [ ] Found last session log: `[filename]`

### Status Assessment
**Last known task**: [From todo or session log]
**Last modified files**: [From session log if available]
**Estimated progress**: [X% through current phase]

### Recovery Action
**Resuming with**: [Specific action to take]
**Verification needed**: [Any work that needs to be checked]

### Continuation Plan
1. [First specific action]
2. [Second specific action]
3. [Pattern for moving forward]
```

---

## ðŸ“‹ TASK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

### **TodoWrite Integration Requirements**
1. **Use TodoWrite extensively** for all task planning and tracking
2. **Mark todos as completed IMMEDIATELY** after finishing tasks
3. **Only have ONE task in_progress** at any time  
4. **Complete existing tasks before starting new ones**

### **Task Completion Standards**
- **ONLY mark completed when FULLY accomplished**
- **If errors/blockers encountered, keep as in_progress**
- **When blocked, create new task describing what needs resolution**
- **Never mark completed if**: Tests failing, implementation partial, unresolved errors, missing dependencies

### **Task Breakdown Principles**
- Create specific, actionable items
- Break complex tasks into manageable steps
- Use clear, descriptive task names
- Include time estimates when possible

---

## ðŸ“Š PROGRESS TRACKING METHODOLOGY

### **Continuous Progress Markers**

#### **After Each File/Component**
```markdown
- âœ… `filename.md` - [STATUS] - Issues: [brief list] - [timestamp]
```

#### **After Each Directory/Section**
```markdown
### [Section] Directory Complete
**Files processed**: X/Y
**Major issues**: [Summary]
**Next target**: [Next section]
**Phase status**: [X% complete]
```

#### **After Each Fix Implementation**
```markdown
### Fix Applied: [File]
**Issue**: [What was wrong]
**Solution**: [What was fixed]  
**Verification**: [How it was tested]
**Status**: [Ready for production / Needs more work]
```

### **Session Log Organization**

#### **File Naming Convention**
```
session-logs/
â”œâ”€â”€ session-[DATE]-[phase]-[focus-area].md
â”œâ”€â”€ session-[DATE]-[component]-[status].md
â””â”€â”€ session-[DATE]-[deliverable]-[completion].md
```

#### **Session Log Template**
```markdown
# Session [Date]: [Phase] - [Focus Area]

## Objective
[What this session is trying to accomplish]

## Starting Status
- **Phase**: [Current phase]
- **Component**: [Current focus]
- **Prior work**: [What was completed before]

## Work Completed
### [Timestamp] - [Task Name]
- **Action**: [What was done]
- **Files**: [What was modified]
- **Result**: [Outcome]

## Current Status
- **Task in progress**: [Current todo item]
- **Files modified this session**: [List]
- **Next action**: [Specific next step]

## Handoff Notes
**For next session**: [Instructions for continuation]
**Critical context**: [Important info not to lose]
**Verification needed**: [Any work to double-check]
```

---

## ðŸ”§ INTERRUPTION HANDLING PROTOCOL

### **Session Interruption Documentation**
When session is interrupted, document:
1. **Current Task Status**: Which todo item was in progress
2. **Files Completed**: Specific files audited and their status
3. **Critical Findings**: Any issues or patterns discovered
4. **Next Actions**: Specific next steps for continuation
5. **Context Notes**: Important information for session handoff

### **Emergency Protocols**

#### **If Unsure About Deletions**
- **STOP** and ask the user explicitly
- Explain exactly what you want to delete and why
- Wait for clear approval before proceeding

#### **If Discovering Major Issues**
- Document the issues clearly
- Present findings to user
- Ask for guidance on how to proceed
- Do not make assumptions about desired actions

## ðŸŽ¯ QUALITY ASSURANCE INTEGRATION

### **Documentation Requirements Between Sessions**
1. **Session logs saved between major tasks**
2. **Progress tracking updated with current status**
3. **Comprehensive reports for major transformations**
4. **Todo lists maintained with current priorities**

### **Strategic Planning Integration**
- **Roadmap established** for all major phases
- **Priority evaluation** prepared for decision points
- **Time estimates updated** based on actual patterns
- **Quality standards maintained** throughout

---

## ðŸ“ˆ SUCCESS METRICS

### **Key Principles**
- **Speed Over Perfection**: Quick updates better than no updates
- **Essential Information Only**: Current task, files worked on, major issues, next action
- **Fail-Safe Recovery**: Always possible to determine where work left off

### **Success Indicators**
- **Zero context loss** between sessions
- **Smooth continuation** regardless of interruption timing
- **Complete audit trail** of all work performed
- **Consistent quality** maintained across sessions

---

## ðŸ”„ ADAPTATION GUIDELINES

### **Customization for Different Projects**
1. **Adjust session log templates** for project-specific needs
2. **Modify todo categorization** based on work types
3. **Customize quality metrics** for domain requirements
4. **Adapt file naming conventions** for organizational standards

### **Scaling Considerations**
- **Small projects**: Simplified logging, basic todo tracking
- **Medium projects**: Full protocol implementation
- **Large projects**: Enhanced reporting, milestone tracking
- **Team projects**: Shared documentation standards, handoff protocols

---

**Remember**: The goal is continuity and progress, not perfect documentation. Consistent application of these patterns enables seamless project continuation regardless of session interruptions or team changes.
