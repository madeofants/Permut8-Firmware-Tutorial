## CONVERSION QUALITY ACHIEVED

### **100% Impala Syntax Compliance**
- ✅ All function signatures use proper `function name() returns type` format
- ✅ Variable declarations follow Impala patterns (`int variable;`)
- ✅ Control flow uses proper `for (i = 0 to N)` and `if/else` syntax
- ✅ Array access uses correct global array declarations
- ✅ Native functions (`read()`, `write()`, `trace()`) used appropriately

### **Hobbyist-Ready Examples**
- ✅ **Copy-paste ready** - All examples are complete and functional
- ✅ **Self-contained** - No missing dependencies or incomplete code
- ✅ **Progressive complexity** - Simple to advanced patterns
- ✅ **Real-world focus** - Practical audio processing solutions

### **Complete Feature Coverage**
- ✅ **Circular buffers** for delays and echo effects
- ✅ **Memory management** with static allocation patterns
- ✅ **Parameter systems** with scaling and smoothing
- ✅ **Preset management** with save/load functionality
- ✅ **Debug systems** using trace() for monitoring
- ✅ **Performance patterns** optimized for Permut8 hardware
