## 📊 FUNDAMENTAL ALGORITHM CORRECTION SUMMARY

### Issues Identified and Resolved
**10 CRITICAL PROBLEMS** identified in light audit #22, now **ALL ADDRESSED**:

### 1. ✅ Incorrect Ratio Implementation - FIXED
**Before (BROKEN BIT-SHIFT RATIO):**
```impala
ratio = ((int)global params[1] >> 3) + 1;         // 1-32 ratio
compressed_overage = overage >> ratio;            // Bit shifting instead of division
```

**After (PROPER COMPRESSION RATIO):**
```impala
ratio = ((int)global params[1] >> 4) + 2;         // 2-17 ratio (reasonable range)
gain_reduction_amount = overage - (overage / ratio);  // Proper division for compression
```

**Impact**: Fixed fundamental compression mathematics - bit shifting by large values produced zero compression

### 2. ✅ Flawed Gain Calculation - FIXED
**Before (ARBITRARY FORMULA):**
```impala
target_gain = 255 - ((overage - compressed_overage) >> 2);  // Incorrect gain calculation
```

**After (PROPER GAIN REDUCTION):**
```impala
// Calculate target gain (255=no reduction, lower=more reduction)
target_gain = 255 - ((gain_reduction_amount << 8) / overage);
if (target_gain < 64) target_gain = 64;  // Limit maximum compression (75% max reduction)
```

**Impact**: Proper gain reduction calculation based on compression theory

### 3. ✅ Attack/Release Logic Correction - FIXED
**Before (PARAMETERS WORKED BACKWARDS):**
```impala
// Attack and release logic was inverted - parameters controlled opposite behaviors
```

**After (CORRECT AUDIO ENGINEERING CONVENTION):**
```impala
if (target_gain < global gain_reduction) {
    // Increasing compression (gain reduction) - use attack time
    global gain_reduction = global gain_reduction - ((global gain_reduction - target_gain) >> attack_factor);
} else {
    // Decreasing compression (gain recovery) - use release time  
    global gain_reduction = global gain_reduction + ((target_gain - global gain_reduction) >> release_factor);
}
```

**Impact**: Attack/release parameters now work according to audio engineering standards

### 4. ✅ Envelope Follower Enhancement - FIXED
**Before (COUNTERINTUITIVE PARAMETERS):**
```impala
attack = ((int)global params[2] >> 3) + 1;        // 1-32 speed (too wide range)
global envelope = global envelope + ((input_level - global envelope) >> attack);
```

**After (REASONABLE PARAMETER RANGES):**
```impala
attack = ((int)global params[2] >> 5) + 1;        // 1-8 attack speed
attack_factor = attack & 7;                       // Limit to 0-7 for reasonable response
global envelope = global envelope + ((input_level - global envelope) >> attack_factor);
```

**Impact**: Proper envelope following with reasonable parameter ranges

### 5. ✅ Threshold Scaling Fix - FIXED
**Before (EXCEEDED AUDIO RANGE):**
```impala
threshold = ((int)global params[0] << 3) + 256;   // 256-2296 range (exceeds ±2047)
```

**After (PROPER AUDIO RANGE):**
```impala
threshold = ((int)global params[0] << 2) + 256;   // 256-1276 range (within audio range)
```

**Impact**: Threshold values now work within Permut8's 12-bit audio range

### 6. ✅ Stereo Processing Implementation - FIXED
**Before (MONO ONLY):**
```impala
output = ((int)global signal[0] * global gain_reduction) >> 8;
global signal[0] = output;
global signal[1] = output;  // Copying mono to both channels
```

**After (TRUE STEREO):**
```impala
int output_left = ((int)global signal[0] * global gain_reduction) >> 8;
int output_right = ((int)global signal[1] * global gain_reduction) >> 8;
global signal[0] = output_left;
global signal[1] = output_right;
```

**Impact**: Proper stereo processing maintaining channel independence

### 7. ✅ Gain Reduction Range Enhancement - FIXED
**Before (LIMITED COMPRESSION):**
```impala
if (target_gain < 128) target_gain = 128;  // Limited to 50% max reduction
```

**After (PROFESSIONAL RANGE):**
```impala
if (target_gain < 64) target_gain = 64;    // Allow up to 75% compression (professional range)
```

**Impact**: Expanded dynamic range control for professional compression applications

### 8. ✅ Variable Declaration Cleanup - FIXED
**Before (POOR READABILITY):**
```impala
locals int threshold, int ratio, int attack, int release, int input_level, int target_gain, int output, int overage, int compressed_overage
```

**After (CLEAR STRUCTURE):**
```impala
locals int threshold
locals int ratio
locals int attack
locals int release
locals int input_level
locals int target_gain
locals int output
locals int overage
locals int gain_reduction_amount
locals int attack_factor
locals int release_factor
```

**Impact**: Improved code readability and added variables for proper algorithm implementation

### 9. ✅ LED Display Enhancement - FIXED
**Before (LIMITED FEEDBACK):**
```impala
global displayLEDs[0] = 255 - global gain_reduction;  // Gain reduction meter
global displayLEDs[1] = global envelope >> 3;         // Input level meter
```

**After (COMPREHENSIVE FEEDBACK):**
```impala
global displayLEDs[0] = 255 - global gain_reduction;  // Gain reduction meter
global displayLEDs[1] = global envelope >> 3;         // Input level meter
global displayLEDs[2] = threshold >> 3;               // Threshold level
global displayLEDs[3] = ratio << 4;                   // Compression ratio
```

**Impact**: Complete visual feedback of all compressor parameters

### 10. ✅ Initialization State Fix - FIXED
**Before (INCORRECT INITIAL STATE):**
```impala
global int gain_reduction = 0   // Started with maximum compression
```

**After (PROPER INITIAL STATE):**
```impala
global int gain_reduction = 255 // Start with no compression (255=no reduction)
```

**Impact**: Compressor starts in proper bypass state
