- Cross-references to non-production content

### **Conversion Process**
1. **Read archived file** + audit report + terminology extract
2. **Light audit current state** (15-20 minutes)
3. **Convert all code to proper Impala syntax**:
   - Add `const int PRAWN_FIRMWARE_PATCH_FORMAT = 2`
   - Add `extern native yield`
   - Add standard globals (`signal[2]`, `params[8]`, `displayLEDs[4]`)
   - Fix function syntax (`function process()` with locals)
4. **Enhance content based on session experience**
5. **Add complete working audio processing example**
6. **Verify A-grade quality** (comprehensive check)

### **Integration Requirements**

3. **Create comprehensive debugging guide**:
   - Systematic error categorization (syntax, logic, hardware, performance)
   - Step-by-step debugging methodology
   - Common error solutions with examples
   - Prevention strategies and best practices
4. **Add complete troubleshooting examples** with Impala syntax
5. **Verify A-grade educational quality**

### **Integration Requirements**
