## üìù LEVEL 0-10 EXPERIMENTAL AUDIT

### **LEVEL 0: "I have no idea what I'm doing"**

**Alex asks**: *"I downloaded Permut8 and I want to make a simple distortion effect for my guitar. I've never programmed audio before. Where do I even start? What is firmware? Why do I need to compile things?"*

**Documentation Retrieved**:
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Should provide immediate orientation
- `getting-audio-in-and-out.md` - Foundation concepts

**Content Test**: 
‚úÖ **QUICKSTART.md provides good orientation** - explains firmware concept, 30-minute path  
‚úÖ **getting-audio-in-and-out.md covers basics well** - 10-minute working audio  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Gap identified**: No explicit "what is firmware vs plugin" explanation for complete newbies

**Alex's likely follow-up**: *"Okay, so firmware is like... the brain of the effect? And I write it in this Impala language?"*

---

### **LEVEL 1: "I want audio to work first"**

**Alex asks**: *"I went through QUICKSTART but I'm confused about Mod vs Full patches. The guide says to choose, but I just want to make a distortion. Which one should I pick? What's the difference for a beginner?"*

**Documentation Retrieved**:
- `mod-vs-full-architecture-guide.md` - Architectural decision guidance

**Content Test**:
‚úÖ **Architecture guide provides excellent decision framework**  
‚úÖ **Clear examples of when to use each approach**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Gap identified**: Could use "distortion example" specifically - most beginners want distortion

**Alex's likely follow-up**: *"So for distortion I should use Full patch because I want complete control? Got it. Now how do I actually get sound through this thing?"*

---

### **LEVEL 2: "My first working audio"**

**Alex asks**: *"I followed the getting-audio-in-and-out tutorial and I have audio passing through! But it's just clean audio. How do I make it distorted? What's the simplest possible distortion I can add?"*

**Documentation Retrieved**:
- `getting-audio-in-and-out.md` - Foundation I/O (completed)
- Need: Basic distortion cookbook recipe

**Content Gap Identified**: 
‚ùå **Missing**: "simplest-possible-distortion.md" - immediate gratification for beginners  
**Available**: `waveshaper-distortion.md` - but may be too complex for Level 2

**Alex's likely follow-up**: *"I see the waveshaper guide, but it's talking about lookup tables and mathematical functions. Can I just multiply the audio by 2 to make it louder and distorted?"*

---

### **LEVEL 3: "Understanding what I'm doing"**

**Alex asks**: *"I tried `signal[0] = signal[0] * 3` and it sounds terrible - really loud and harsh. The tutorial mentions 'clipping' and 'audio range'. What did I do wrong? How do I make good-sounding distortion?"*

**Documentation Retrieved**:
- `audio_processing_reference.md` - Should explain audio range and clipping
- `waveshaper-distortion.md` - Mathematical distortion approaches

**Content Test**:
‚úÖ **Audio processing reference explains clipping well**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Gap identified**: No "beginner-friendly distortion progression" from multiply ‚Üí proper distortion  

**Missing Content Needed**:
```impala
// Level 2 distortion - safe clipping
if (signal[0] > 1000) signal[0] = 1000;
if (signal[0] < -1000) signal[0] = -1000;

// Level 3 distortion - soft clipping  
signal[0] = signal[0] * 2;
if (signal[0] > 2047) signal[0] = 2047;
if (signal[0] < -2047) signal[0] = -2047;
```

**Alex's likely follow-up**: *"Okay, so I need to prevent it from going over the limits. But how do I make it sound like a real guitar pedal instead of just harsh clipping?"*

---

### **LEVEL 4: "Making it sound good"**

**Alex asks**: *"I have basic clipping working, but it doesn't sound like my guitar pedals. I want that smooth, warm overdrive sound. The waveshaper guide mentions 'tanh' and 'curves' - what does that mean for someone who doesn't know math?"*

**Documentation Retrieved**:
- `waveshaper-distortion.md` - Mathematical approaches
- Need: "Musical distortion for beginners"

**Content Gap Identified**:
‚ùå **Missing**: Bridge between mathematical distortion and musical results  
‚ùå **Missing**: "How distortion curves affect sound character" for non-math people

**Needed Addition**:
```markdown
## How Distortion Shapes Affect Your Guitar Sound

### Hard Clipping (harsh, digital):
signal = clamp(signal * gain, -2047, 2047)
*Sounds like*: Fuzz boxes, aggressive rock

### Soft Clipping (smooth, warm):  
if (signal > 1000) signal = 1000 + (signal-1000)/4
*Sounds like*: Tube amps, vintage overdrive
```

**Alex's likely follow-up**: *"That makes sense! So different math creates different sounds. How do I control how much distortion happens with the knobs?"*

---

### **LEVEL 5: "Adding controls"**

**Alex asks**: *"I want to control the distortion amount with Knob 1. I read about params[0] being 0-255, but how do I turn that into a good distortion control? Should 0 be clean and 255 be maximum distortion?"*

**Documentation Retrieved**:
- `read-knobs.md` - Parameter reading basics
- `parameter-mapping.md` - Professional parameter design

**Content Test**:
‚úÖ **Read-knobs covers basic parameter reading well**  
‚úÖ **Parameter mapping covers scaling techniques**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Gap**: No "distortion parameter design" examples for beginners

**Missing Content for Level 5**:
```impala
// Distortion gain control (musical scaling)
int distortionAmount = 1 + (params[0] * 10 / 255);  // 1x to 11x gain
signal[0] = signal[0] * distortionAmount;
// Add clipping here...
```

**Alex's likely follow-up**: *"Cool! Now I have a working distortion pedal. But I notice it gets really loud when I increase distortion. How do I keep the volume consistent?"*

---

### **LEVEL 6: "Professional techniques"**

**Alex asks**: *"My distortion works but has two problems: 1) It gets louder as I increase distortion, and 2) I hear clicking when I turn the knobs. How do I fix these issues like a real plugin developer?"*

**Documentation Retrieved**:
- `parameter-mapping.md` - Professional parameter design  
- `complete-development-workflow.md` - Professional practices
- Need: "Audio engineering fundamentals for programmers"

**Content Gap Identified**:
‚ùå **Missing**: "Gain compensation" techniques for beginners  
‚ùå **Missing**: "Parameter smoothing" in accessible terms

**Alex's likely follow-up**: *"I see references to 'parameter smoothing' and 'gain compensation' but I need step-by-step examples. How do I implement these professionally?"*

---

### **LEVEL 7: "Optimization and quality"**

**Alex asks**: *"My effect works great! But I want to add more features like tone control and maybe multiple distortion types. I'm worried about performance - how do I know if my code is efficient enough? And how do I organize more complex code?"*

**Documentation Retrieved**:
- `optimization-basics.md` - Performance fundamentals
- `architecture_patterns.md` - Code organization
- `complete-development-workflow.md` - Professional structure

**Content Test**:
‚úÖ **Optimization basics covers performance measurement well**  
‚úÖ **Architecture patterns provide good organization guidance**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Gap**: No "when to optimize" guidance for beginners

**Alex's likely follow-up**: *"I see I can measure performance, but when should I worry about it? And how do I add multiple effect types without making spaghetti code?"*

---

### **LEVEL 8: "Advanced features"**

**Alex asks**: *"I want to add preset saving so I can store my favorite distortion settings. I also want to sync some effects to the tempo of my DAW. How do I integrate with the host like commercial plugins?"*

**Documentation Retrieved**:
- `preset-system.md` - Complete preset management
- `midi-sync.md` - Tempo synchronization  
- `integration/` theme - Professional integration

**Content Test**:
‚úÖ **Preset system provides comprehensive implementation**  
‚úÖ **MIDI sync covers tempo integration well**  
‚úÖ **Integration theme covers professional aspects**

**Alex's likely follow-up**: *"This is getting complex! How do I manage all these features without breaking my working distortion? Do I need better development practices?"*

---

### **LEVEL 9: "Professional development"**

**Alex asks**: *"I'm building more complex effects now and sometimes introduce bugs that break everything. I need professional development practices like testing and debugging. How do professional developers manage complex audio projects?"*

**Documentation Retrieved**:
- `debug-your-plugin.md` - Systematic debugging
