# Streamlined Audit: Integration Files Batch 1 (2 files)

## Files Audited:
- preset-friendly.md (100 lines examined)
- preset-system.md (100 lines examined)

## Individual File Results:

### preset-friendly.md - üü° NEEDS FIXES
**Status**: Conceptual content with mixed syntax
**Issues**: 
- Uses non-Impala syntax (let bindings, static declarations)
- Rust-like syntax patterns
- Note acknowledges syntax issues and points to proper implementation

### preset-system.md - üü¢ GOOD  
**Status**: Valid Impala implementation
**Issues**: None found
- Proper Impala const declarations and syntax
- Valid firmware implementation patterns
- Professional integration code

## Technical Validation Results

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Syntax Consistency**: MIXED
- preset-system.md uses proper Impala syntax
- preset-friendly.md uses non-Impala syntax with disclaimer

### ‚úÖ **Integration Concepts**: EXCELLENT
- Strong conceptual framework
- Professional preset system design
- Practical implementation guidance

### ‚úÖ **Terminology**: PERFECT
- Correct preset and integration terminology
- Professional technical language

## Overall Assessment

**Integration section shows mixed quality** - some files have proper Impala implementations while others use conceptual syntax that won't compile.

**Combined Time to Fix**: 15 minutes (clarify conceptual vs implementation distinction)

## Recommendation

**Pattern Identified**: Some integration files are conceptual (with syntax disclaimers) while others are practical implementations. Consider standardizing approach.
